  abstract = {Abstract In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing
	a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem.
	Since that time, due in large part to ad- vances in digital computing,
	the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive re- search and
	application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation.
	The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides
	an efficient com- putational (recursive) means to estimate the state
	of a process, in a way that mini- mizes the mean of the squared error.
	The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations
	of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when
	the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose
	of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete
	Kal- man filter. This introduction includes a description and some
	discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description
	and some discussion of the extend- ed Kalman filter, and a relatively
	simple (tangible) example with real numbers & results.},

  abstract = {Smoothing splines via the penalized least squares method provide versatile
	and effective nonparametric models for regression with Gaussian responses.
	The computation of smoothing splines is generally of the order O.n3/,
	n being the sample size, which severely limits its practical applicability.
	We study more scalable computation of smoothing spline regression
	via certain low dimensional approximations that are asymptotically
	as efficient. A simple algo- rithm is presented and the Bayes model
	that is associated with the approximations is derived, with the latter
	guiding the porting of Bayesian confidence intervals. The practical
	choice of the dimension of the approximating space is determined
	through simulation studies, and empirical comparisons of the approximations
	with the exact solution are presented. Also evaluated is a simple
	modification of the generalized cross-validation method for smoothing
	parameter selec- tion, which to a large extent fixes the occasional
	undersmoothing problem that is suffered by generalized cross-validation.},

  abstract = {In classical smoothing splines, the smoothness is controlled by a
	single smoothing parameter that penalizes the roughness uniformly
	across the whole do- main. Adaptive smoothing splines extend this
	framework to allow the smoothing parameter to change in the domain,
	adapting to the change of roughness. In this article we propose a
	data driven method to nonparametrically model the penalty function.
	We propose to approximate the penalty function by a step function
	whose segmentation is data driven, and to estimate it by maximizing
	the generalized like- lihood. A complexity penalty is added to the
	generalized likelihood in selecting the best step function from a
	collection of candidates. A state space representation for the adaptive
	smoothing splines is derived to ease the computational demand. To
	allow for fast search among the candidate models, we impose a binary
	tree structure on the penalty function and propose an efficient search
	algorithm. We show the consistency of the final estimate. We demonstrate
	the effectiveness of the method through simulations and a data example.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper deals with an on line identification of the values
	of these entities by a suitable adjusting of the filter gain and
	incorporating information about the quality of innovation sequence.
	The result yields a new adaptive Kalman filter. The proposal is mainly
	based on statistical properties of the innovation sequence of the
	filter and improves some previous results pointed out by Bellanger
	and Mehra. Particularly, the autocorrelation function of the innovation
	sequence is used. Furthermore, information about the quality of the
	autocorrelation parameter is incorporated through a weighted least
	squares methodology. The determination of the weights is based on
	a distance criterion, which involves the ideal probability distribution
	and the current probability referring to the first and second order
	statistics of autocorrelation functions. The estimation of the a
	priori noise statistics Q and R is obtained straightforwardly from
	the preceding and the optimal gain and the innovation covariance
	of the filter.},

  abstract = {A new type of algebraic spline is used to derive a filter for smoothing
	or interpolating discrete data points. The spline is dependent on
	control parameters that specify the relative importance of data fitting
	and the derivatives of the spline. A general spline of arbitrary
	order is first formulated using matrix equations. We then focus on
	eighth-order splines because of the continuity of their first three
	derivatives (desirable for motor and robotics applications). The
	spline's matrix equations are rewritten to give a recursive filter
	that can be implemented in real time for lengthy data sequences.
	The filter is lowpass with a bandwidth that is dependent on the spline's
	control parameters. Numerical results, including a simple image processing
	application, show the tradeoffs that can be achieved using the algebraic
	splines.},

  abstract = {Summary. Penalized likelihood methods provide a range of practical
	modelling tools, including spline smoothing, generalized additive
	models and variants of ridge regression. Selecting the correct weights
	for penalties is a critical part of using these methods and in the
	single penalty case the analyst has several well founded techniques
	to choose from. However, many mod- elling problems suggest a formulation
	employing multiple penalties, and here general method- ology is lacking.
	A wide family of models with multiple penalties can be fitted to
	data by iter- a􏱂tive solution of the generalized ridge regression
	problem: minimise ∥W1/2(Xp − y)∥2ρ + m θip′S p (p is a parameter
	vector, X a design matrix, Si a non-negative definite coeffi- i=1
	i cient matrix defining the ith penalty with associated smoothing
	parameter θi, W a diagonal weight matrix, y a vector of data or pseudodata
	and ρ an `overall' smoothing parameter in- cluded for reasons of
	computational efficiency). This paper shows how smoothing parameter
	selection can be performed efficiently by applying generalized cross
	validation to this problem and how this allows non-linear, generalized
	linear and linear models to be fitted using multiple penalties, substantially
	increasing the scope of penalized modelling methods. Examples of
	non-linear modelling, generalized additive modelling and anisotropic
	smoothing are given.},

  abstract = {To determination the volume and weight of non- uniform bodies, such
	as in ore deposits evalua- tion for mining and rock cutting for construction,
	the methods of interpolation are usually used. The classic curves,
	which are frequently used to interpolate one-dimensional data are
	cubic spl- ine, Bspline and Bezier curves. These methods have good
	efficiency for determination of geom- etric characteristics of nonregular
	masses. They have some limitations and problems with two- dimensional
	interpolation analysis such as for- ming large linear systems of
	equations with a lot of entries and difficulty encounter with their
	solutions. In this research the two-dimensional splines are used,
	which have the advantages of simplicity and less computational operations
	ef- fort. The spline functions that are applied have the continuity
	of C1 at elements boundaries. The presented model has suitable efficiency
	for vo- lumes of large extents governing to lots of data.},
