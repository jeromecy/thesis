	Abstract = {A self-organizing filter and smoother for the general nonlinear non-Gaussian
	state-space model is proposed. An expanded state-space model is defined
	by augmenting the state vector with the unknown parameters of the
	original state-space model. The state of the augmented state-space
	model, and hence the state and the parameters of the original state-space
	model, are estimated simultaneously by either a non-Gaussian filter/smoother
	or a {M}onte {C}arlo filter/smoother. In contrast to maximum likelihood
	estimation of model parameters in ordinary state-space modeling,
	for which the recursive filter computation has to be done many times,
	model parameter estimation in the proposed self-organizing filter/smoother
	is achieved with only two passes of the recursive filter and smoother
	operations. Examples such as automatic tuning of dispersion and the
	shape parameters, adaptation to changes of the amplitude of a signal
	in seismic data, state estimation for a nonlinear state space model
	with unknown parameters, and seasonal adjustment with a nonlinear
	model with changing variance parameters are shown to exemplify the
	usefulness of the proposed method.},
