First of all, I am so grateful to my main supervisor Dr. Matthew Parry. He offered me this golden opportunity to join this joint project with Physics department and work with him and other talent researchers. His extensive knowledge at Statistics and Physics lead me on the right way and encourage me throughout this difficult project. His passionate at exploring unknown world of science motivated me and will be motivating me to go further and deeper in the area of developing and implementing statistical models.  

Secondly, I would like to appreciate my co-supervisor Professor David Brant for his great help in my research process. He gave me extraordinary supports in the first six months of my second year when Matthew was away. His guidance and expert advice inspired me in finding a new method and lighted my way into darkness. 

A special gratitude goes out to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment for supporting my study and this research. This project would have been impossible without their generous fundings. Additionally, many thanks to TracMap company for providing all the research GPS data, which is the base stone of all the work. 

Moreover, I want to thank all the support staff at Mathematics and Statistics Department for their great job, including Lenette, Marguerite, Leanne, Chris and Greg, and give many thanks to my officemates and friends, including but not limited to Paula, Chuen Yan, Johannes, Vivian, Juan, Bob and his family, Freddy and his family, for their friendship and accompanying me during the three years. We had enjoyable and unforgeable experiences together. 

And finally, last but by no means least, I will thank my parents for their wise counsel and encouragements to me for studying overseas, and my beloved wife Yingying for all her love and support, and my daughter Anyang, who was born in my second year of study. She is the greatest accomplishment of my life.

Thanks for all your encouragements!
