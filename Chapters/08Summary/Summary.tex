Inference and characterization of planar trajectories have been problems that confusing researchers for years. Precise and efficient algorithms are highly demanded in all kinds of applications. 

In this thesis, the proposed Tractor spline provides a more accurate reconstruction from all the observed data. It can be easily applied in higher dimensional spaces. The Bayesian estimate of Tractor spline can be widely used in complex situations. However, duo to its natural limitation, Tractor spline is not applicable for instant estimation, or requires higher computational capability.  Therefore, an adaptive sequential MCMC algorithm was proposed to estimate combined unknown parameters and state for linear state space models instantly. It is no doubt that the more data involved in the estimation process the better, however, higher time consuming was incurred. The sliding window algorithm is a compromising solution between accuracy and efficiency, by which it is easily to track and monitor a maneuver target. 

The proposed algorithms in this thesis are contributing to related areas, nevertheless, are not perfect. Further research and works are required to improve their performances.
